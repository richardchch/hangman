## Project Description

### Project Objective
This Python-based implementation of the classic word guessing game, Hangman, challenges players to guess a secret word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses. Each incorrect guess results in a loss of a life, with the game ending when the player runs out of lives or successfully guesses the word.

### Project Aim 
The project aims to provide an interactive way to play Hangman through the command line. It's designed to help beginners understand basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, lists, and string manipulation.

### Insights Gained
Developing this game helped me learn:
- **Control Structures**: Using loops and conditionals to manage game flow.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizing lists and strings to store game data.
- **Function Definition**: Creating and using functions to organize code and make it reusable.
- **Input Handling**: Validating and processing user input effectively.

## Installation

To run this game, you will need Python installed on your computer. Python 3.6 or higher is recommended. You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After installing Python, download the game code to your local machine. No additional libraries are required to run the game as it uses only the Python standard library.

## Usage

To start playing the game, navigate to the directory containing the game script and run:

`python hangman.py`
