## Project Overview

### Objective
This project is a Python implementation of the classic word-guessing game, **Hangman**. The game challenges players to guess a secret word by suggesting letters within a fixed number of guesses. Each incorrect guess results in a life being lost, and the game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.

### Purpose
The primary aim of this project is to create an interactive command-line version of Hangman. It is designed to help beginners gain a practical understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as:
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Data structures (lists, strings)
- Function definition and usage
- Input validation and error handling

### Skills Developed
Working on this project has provided insights into:
- **Control Flow**: Implementing loops and conditionals to manage the game's logic.
- **Data Handling**: Using lists and strings for storing and manipulating game data.
- **Function Design**: Organizing the code into reusable functions for better structure and readability.
- **Input Handling**: Ensuring the program properly handles and validates user input to avoid errors and crashes.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Hangman game locally, you will need Python 3.6 or higher. 

### Steps to install:
1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Download the Project**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   - To clone the repository using Git, run the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
     ```
3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the game is located:

4. **Run the Game**: Since the game relies on the Python standard library, no additional libraries need to be installed. To start playing the game, run the following command in the terminal: `python hangman.py`

## Usage Instructions

Once the game is running, you will be prompted to guess a letter. You can continue guessing until you either:
- Guess the word correctly
- Run out of attempts

The game will display the current state of the word after each guess and notify you of the remaining attempts.

## File Structure

The project has the following directory and file structure:

```bash
hangman-game/
  ├── hangman.py # Main script containing the Hangman class and game logic
  └── README.md # This README file
```

### `hangman.py`
This is the core script containing the game logic. It defines:
- The **Hangman class**: Responsible for managing the game's state, including tracking the secret word, guesses, and remaining lives.
- The **play_game function**: Handles the game flow, allowing players to make guesses and interact with the game.
